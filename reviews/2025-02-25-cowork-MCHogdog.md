Michael's backend implementation review. Code quality has significantly improved - much more maintainable and efficient. Still needs work on error handling patterns. Great attitude towards learning and implementing best practices.

Key observations:
- Visible improvement in code quality
- Strong learning curve
- Error handling needs work
- Positive attitude towards feedback
