Today worked with Alex on the frontend optimization project. His attention to performance metrics is impressive. Identified and fixed several bottlenecks in the rendering pipeline. However, documentation could be more thorough - had to ask several follow-up questions about implementation details.

Key points:
- Strong technical skills in performance optimization
- Good problem-solving approach
- Documentation needs improvement
- Communication could be clearer
