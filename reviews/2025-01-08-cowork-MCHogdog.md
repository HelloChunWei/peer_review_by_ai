First sprint planning with Michael. Shows great enthusiasm and brings innovative ideas to the table. However, some proposed solutions were overly complex for our current needs. Need to focus on maintainable, straightforward implementations.

Areas of note:
- Creative problem solver
- High energy and motivation
- Tendency to over-engineer
- Good team player
