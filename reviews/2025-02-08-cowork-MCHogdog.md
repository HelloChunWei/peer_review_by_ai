Worked with Michael on the API security enhancements today. While his technical implementation was solid, I noticed a concerning pattern regarding security practices. Multiple times during our collaboration, he left his workstation unlocked while going to meetings or lunch breaks. This violates our company's security policy and could potentially expose sensitive information.

Areas of concern:
- Consistently leaves computer unlocked when away from desk
- Need to reinforce the importance of basic security protocols
- Should develop better security awareness habits

Action items discussed:
- Reminded about company security policy
- Agreed to use Win+L shortcut for quick locking
- Will set up auto-lock after 5 minutes of inactivity

Despite this security oversight, his work on the API security features was thorough and well-implemented. Just need to ensure personal security practices match his technical security implementations.
