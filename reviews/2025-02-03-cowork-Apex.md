Collaborated with Alex on API integration. Successfully implemented new endpoints ahead of schedule. His code is clean and well-structured. One concern: tends to work in isolation and could benefit from more frequent check-ins with the team.

Observations:
- Excellent coding standards
- Delivers ahead of schedule
- Needs to improve team collaboration
- Could share knowledge more proactively
